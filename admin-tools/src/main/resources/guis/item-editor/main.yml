      in rare situations. For example,
      the GUI isn't able to show this
      change and when it's being
      transferred to your inventory,
      it might not keep its amount.

      {$sep}This is used for resource packs
      that are made for 1.14+
      to add new items to the game.
      This is basically just a reskin
      of the same item type.
      This is what plugins like ItemsAdder
      use to add new items to the game.
