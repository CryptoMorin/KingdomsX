# A kingdom can have these types of relation with another kingdom: Neutral, Enemy, Truce, Ally and Nation
# Let's say nation A is allies with nation B.
# If A who requested to be allies with nation B accepts or declines B relation terms, the relation attributes from B will be used.
# For example if nation A wants to build in nation B land, and nation A has build attribute but nation B doesn't, it'll listen to nation Bs attributes.
# Kingdom Allies, truces and enemies have more priority. If A has kingdom a and B has kingdom b, and a is allies with b,
# then it'll listen to relation attributes of allies in b regardless of their nation's relation. If a and b are both in the
# same nation their relation will always be "Nation" regardless of the kingdom's relation.

# Relation request to a nation or a kingdom.
request-expiration: 1 day

# If kingdoms relations should be checked when
# interacting with a kingdom that is not in the same nation.
prioritize-kingdom-relations: true

# Allow kingdoms to have separate relations with kingdoms that are in their nation?
# If you use this, it'll destroy the whole purpose of nation relations.
allow-relations-between-nation-kingdoms: false

# This merely manages the data saved, so it applies after a server restart.
# To disable it completely, remove it from the Nexus Settings GUI. The players will keep their relation data until the server
# is restarted if you keep the GUI.
custom-attributes: true

# The PvP mode of the plugin. Needs a restart to be changed due to performance issues.
# normal - Players can PvP anywhere based on their relation attributes.
# claimed - Players can only PvP inside of claimed lands based on their relation attributes.
# unclaimed - Players can only PvP outside of claimed lands based on their relation attributes.
# masswar - Players can only pvp anywhere during masswars.
# Note that when using the last two options, if one player is a claimed land and the other is in an unclaimed land, they cannot PvP.
pvp: normal

# Only apply kingdom relations if both parties agree on that specific relation attribute. Meaning that
# the attribute will only take effects if they both enabled that attribute for their relation in kingdom settings.
# Requires a server restart to be applied.
# If set to false, only the receiving end's relation attributes will be taken into account.
# What that means is, if you're trying to attack a player from a kingdom with their ceasefire attribute set to false
# but your kingdom has the ceasefire attribute for the relation set to true, your members will not be able to attack the
# kingdom, but that kingdom will be able to attack your members. That doesn't sound like something you'd want in most cases.
agreements: true

# auto-revoke: If a kingdom declares that they no longer wish to be in a relation
# with the other kingdom, the other kingdom will automatically have this relation revoked as well.
# ceasefire: Members of the two kingdoms cannot PvP each other.
# donate: Kingdoms can donate resource points to each other clicking their nexus. Note that they'll still be able to use /k donate
# build: Kingdoms can build in each others lands, however you can't touch any turrets or structures.
# invade: If kingdoms can invade each other.
# interact: Kingdoms can interact and open chests, enchantment tables and other containers.
# use: Kingdoms can use buttons, open doors and use pressure plates.
# manage: Kingdoms can remove and place turrets and structures in your land.
# Note that the placed turrets/structures will be for the kingdom that owns that land.
# limit: How many kingdoms can a single kingdom have this type of relation with? Set to 0 for unlimited.
