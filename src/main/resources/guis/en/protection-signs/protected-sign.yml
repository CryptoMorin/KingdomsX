      Player settings override the kingdom
      settings. Meaning that if a player is
      a part of an included or excluded kingdom,
      they can still use the block if the kingdom
      is excluded or not use the block if the
      kingdom is included.

      against griefs and no player can use it

      or break the sign or the block.

      This only works if the block being protected
      is a container such as a chest.
