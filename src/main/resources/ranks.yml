  # Ranks have a lot of data and it helps the IO operation a lot of they're not saved.
  # When the plugin wants to load data, first it checks if that option is enabled.
  # If it's disabled it'll just copy the default ranks from this file
  # Then when the plugin wants to save data, it checks the option again and if it's disabled,
  # it'll not write the rank settings to the json file. It doesn't matter what you changed in your rank settings.
  # You can keep them as long as your kingdom didn't go through a cache cycle, but after that it'll go back to defaults below.
