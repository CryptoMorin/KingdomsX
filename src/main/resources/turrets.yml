# Please refer to Turrets folder if you want to configure each turret.

# If you don't want to use turrets, set this to false. It'll increase the performance drastically.
# But you still need to remove the option from the nexus GUI so people can't buy any.
# Needs a restart to work.

# Allow players in kingdoms to place turrets in unclaimed lands?
# They still need to be in a kingdom to use the turrets.

# Seconds before turrets can shoot players after they've been teleported.

# NOTE: BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING THIS OPTION:
# By changing this option you're changing how often turrets perform checks and ativate.
# By default it is 1 ticks. Meaning every 1 second, 20 checks are performed.
# If you change it to 2 ticks for instance, all the "time" based turret options will be affected.
# Meaning if the turret's cooldown was "10" ticks now it's "10 * 2 = 20" ticks.
# Every single number of this option matters up to 100 ticks for performance. After 100 ticks the performance is just not noticable anymore.
# Requires a restart to update.
