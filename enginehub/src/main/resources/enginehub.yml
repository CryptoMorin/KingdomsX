      # FastAsyncWorldEdit (FAWE) additionally checks the file's
      # extension before checking the file format and may ignore

    # The default built-in schematics shipped with this addon are made
    # using the old original "MCEDIT_SCHEMATIC" (.mcedit) format so
    # that both old and newer versions support these schematics.
    #
    # However, for some reason, FastAsyncWorldEdit (FAWE) doesn't
    # recognize files with ".schematic" extension as any valid schematic format.
    # They require ".schem" instead without even checking the file content.
    # It even accepts random extensions that don't even exist,
    # but it's not okay with .schematic which doesn't make sense.
    # This option renames all schematics in the "Kingdoms/schematics" folder
    # to have this extension before being loaded.
    # If set to ~, then the plugin will automatically apply fixes when needed
    # and the format used is the preferred format extension by the format implementation
    # provided by WorldEdit.
