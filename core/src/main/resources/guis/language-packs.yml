      &7They're all under &2500kb
      &7note that always the latest version is
      downloaded, so if a GUI/message gets
      renamed, moved or deleted which rarely
      happens, the plugin &cwill not be able
      to show them.

      &2English &7is always installed and
      &ccannot be uninstalled &7since its
      the 'reference' language.

      &7All downloaded language packs are saved
      in a folder named &2repository&7. That
      folder should never be edited manually.
      That's the reference folder.

      If you want to modify the downloaded
      languages, you should do so in the
      &2languages &7folder instead. Even deleting
      those are fine, the plugin will regenerate
      them back without redownloading.
