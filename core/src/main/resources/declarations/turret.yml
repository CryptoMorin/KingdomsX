# Schema is a block pattern describing the blocks and their positions that must be placed
# around where you want to place your building.
# in order to actually place it. Not having the correct blocks or position will prevent
# you from placing down buildings.
# It's an interactive way to allow your players to build parts of the buildings themselves.
schema:
  1:
    # Where is the xz center of the pattern?
    # You determine this based on the pattern you put in "blocks"
    origin: [ 1, 1 ]

    # The block pattern. "x" represents any.
    # Other symbols must be manually mapped under "mappings" option.
    # * The "-1" here refers to the y position of the pattern.
    #   The reason why it's -1 here is that when you want to place
    #   your turrets, you right-click on top of a fence, and you want to
    #   look at the layer under the turret itself, which is where the fence is.
    # * The pattern itself is the xz of the blocks.
