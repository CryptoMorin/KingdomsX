# Things that damage (decrease the durability), paralyze, hypnotize, etc... the turret.
# If an arrow or a splash potion has multiple effects, all of them will apply.
#
# All custom effects mentioned here, except 'hypnotize' have no effect when accidentally
# (or even intentionally) done by an ally to a friendly turret.
#
# If two conflicting effects are applied, e.g. a 10sec paralysis and a 5sec paralysis,
# the newer one will override the last one regardless of how strong the older one is.
#
# Siege cannon damages are separatedly configured by their ammo type.
# Note: Only the "damage" setting works on structures, others have no effect.
# ----------------------------
# Effects:
#   * damage: Decreases the durability of the turret.
#   * paralyze: Prevents the turret from automatically shooting at any targets temporarily.
#               However, the cooldown does not persist between restarts. This effect will
#               override the hypnotize effect and prevents the turret from shooting altogether.
#   * hypnotize: Makes the turret attack the members of the kingdom that the turret was placed
#                in, but not their allies. Has no effect when an ally uses this.
#   * slowness: Makes the turret work slower. Specified in ticks. The "cooldown" placeholder can be used
#               for these effects.
#   * weakness: Makes the turret damage less. The number specified will be subtracted from the final damage.
#               The "damage" placeholder can be used for these effects which is the current damage.
