# Should the plugin use a prefix for every message (except chats of course)?
# A prefix like "[Kingdoms]" is added so players know that the message came from Kingdoms plugin.

# If this is set to true, you can use "NOPREFIX|" at the beginning of the messages to exclude the prefix regardless.
# Prefixes are not shown for Complex Messages by default even if this option is enabled.

  # The "update" folder in "plugins" folder (the folder name can be changed in bukkit.yml) is used to
  # automatically replace any JARs in that folder with the JARs in "plugins" folder that have the same name.
  # Now, because the plugin JAR name format is "name-version", this name must be

  # enabling this will allow you to synchronize non-translatable options across all
  # GUIs in other languages when they're changed.
  # You can also write "[NoSync]" at the beginning of a comment of a YAML option to
  # exclude that option from being synchronized. This is used for advanced translatable
