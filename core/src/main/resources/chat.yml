# The chat priority that kingdom handles. Note that changing this will not disable the chat in any way.
# This is used when you're using another plugin that manages chat spams and other restrictions. You might want to increase the priorty in these cases.
# This option requires a restart to work.
# In Bukkit logic, lower priorities mean executed before the higher priorities.
# So for example, if a plugin like Essentials or LiteBans uses NORMAL priority to format chat or mute players,
# you'd have to choose HIGH priority so Kingdoms can know that the chat has been cancelled by these plugins.
# Normally you shouldn't and wouldn't need to use the MONITOR priority, but if a plugin uses higher priorities for
# any reason (which they shouldn't) you can use it. Using MONITOR can cause many other issues.
# We will use the HIGHEST priority here just in case.
# LOWEST, LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, HIGHEST, MONITOR
priority: HIGHEST

# Should kingdoms plugin completely cancel the chat event?
# This is useful customize some plugins such as DiscordSRV, but
# it can also break other plugins like the ones that mute players.
# In these cases, you usually have to set the priority to MONITOR
# (even tho it's not recommended) and it might work.

# Kingdoms plugin chat system by default, acts like an anti-reporting plugin itself if this option is kept enabled.

# You can either use the channel ID or name (case-insensitive). If your channel name changes regularly

# There are two special values. "$console" which uses the console channel from DiscordSRV
# and "$main" that uses the main chat channel from DiscordSRV. Note that the dollar signs are
# only for these two keywords, when using the channel name or ID you DO NOT need to use them.
# You need to /k reload after changing this option.
# Used for kingdom, allies, truces and nations channels.
# Using any channel here requires you to enter that channel's information
# in DiscordSRV's config.yml "Channels" option. This is most likely already defined for your
# normal chat channel, but if you wish to see private messages as webhook messages in your console,
# or any other channel, you'd need to add the channel in the config as well.
# You can also set these two options to ~ to disable them.
