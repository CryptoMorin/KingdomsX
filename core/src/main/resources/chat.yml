# The chat priority that kingdom handles. Note that changing this will not disable the chat in any way.
# This is used when you're using another plugin that manages chat spams and other restrictions. You might want to increase the priorty in these cases.
# This option requires a restart to work.
# In Bukkit logic, lower priorities mean executed before the higher priorities.
# So for example, if a plugin like Essentials or LiteBans uses NORMAL priority to format chat or mute players,
# you'd have to choose HIGH priority so Kingdoms can know that the chat has been cancelled by these plugins.
# Normally you shouldn't and wouldn't need to use the MONITOR priority, but if a plugin uses higher priorities for
# any reason (which they shouldn't) you can use it. Using MONITOR can cause many other issues.
# We will use the HIGHEST priority here just in case.

# Should kingdoms plugin completely cancel the chat event?
# This is useful customize some plugins such as DiscordSRV, but
# it can also break other plugins like the ones that mute players.
# In these cases, you usually have to set the priority to MONITOR
# (even tho it's not recommended) and it might work.

# It's 1.19, again, the cursed number 9 that is, and Microsoft can't get away without making

# was added in 1.19. Although the reporting system shouldn't work at all in Spigot (or any forks of it),
# Kingdoms plugin chat system by default, acts like an anti-reporting plugin itself if this option is kept enabled.
# Another plugin that specializes in this field specifically is: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/103782/

# You need to /k reload after changing this option.
# Used for kingdom, allies, truces and nations channels.
# Using any channel here requires you to enter that channel's information
# in DiscordSRV's config.yml "Channels" option. This is most likely already defined for your
# normal chat channel, but if you wish to see private messages as webhook messages in your console,
# or any other channel, you'd need to add the channel in the config as well.
# You can also set these two options to ~ to disable them.
