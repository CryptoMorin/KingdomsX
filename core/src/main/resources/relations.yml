# A kingdom can have these types of relation with another kingdom: Neutral, Enemy, Truce, Ally and Nation
# Let's say nation A is allies with nation B.
# If A who requested to be allies with nation B accepts or declines B relation terms, the relation attributes from B will be used.
# For example if nation A wants to build in nation B land, and nation A has build attribute but nation B doesn't, it'll listen to nation Bs attributes.
# Kingdom Allies, truces and enemies have more priority. If A has kingdom a and B has kingdom b, and a is allies with b,
# then it'll listen to relation attributes of allies in b regardless of their nation's relation. If a and b are both in the
# same nation their relation will always be "Nation" regardless of the kingdom's relation.

# Relation request to a nation or a kingdom.

# The PvP mode of the plugin. Needs a restart to be changed due to performance issues.
# disabled - The plugin doesn't do anything.
# disallowed - Don't allow anyone to PvP. This is mostly useful only when relational pvp types are enabled.
# normal - Players can PvP anywhere based on their relation attributes.
# claimed - Players can only PvP inside of claimed lands based on their relation attributes.
# unclaimed - Players can only PvP outside of claimed lands based on their relation attributes.
# masswar - Players can only pvp anywhere during masswars.
# territory - Players can pvp if both of them are not in their own or allies kingdom lands.
#    that means player X is only protected if he is in his own claimed land (or an ally). Not when he's in an unclaimed land or a neutral, truce or enemy land.
#    "Allies" in this context refers to any relation with ceasefire attribute.
# relational - Allows you to configure the PvP mode of relations individually.
# conditional - Only use the "pvp-advanced" conditional option below without evaluating this rule.
# Note: When using the claimed/unclaimed options, if one player is a claimed land and the other is in an unclaimed land, they cannot PvP.
# Note: If one of the players is invading any land this option acts like "normal"
pvp: normal

# When the options above don't exactly satisfy your needs you
# can always use a custom condition. However the option above
# has more performance advantages over using this.
# If you set the above "pvp" option to "conditional" that means that you need
# to define basic rules for relationships, like:
# kingdoms_relation == '...'
# - Primary Context: The attacker player.
# - Secondary Context: The victim player.
# - Special Variables:
#     * ceasefire - Whether the kingdom of these two players have the ceasefire attribute based on their relationship.
#     * can_fight - Only works if "pvp" is not set to "conditional" will give the result based on the basic ruling of "pvp" option.
# When this condition evaluates to true, the two players can fight, otherwise they cannot.

# Only apply kingdom relations if both parties agree on that specific relation attribute. Meaning that
# the attribute will only take effects if they both enabled that attribute for their relation in kingdom settings.
# Requires a server restart to be applied.
# If set to false, only the receiving end's relation attributes will be taken into account.
# What that means is, if you're trying to attack a player from a kingdom with their ceasefire attribute set to false
# but your kingdom has the ceasefire attribute for the relation set to true, your members will not be able to attack the
# kingdom, but that kingdom will be able to attack your members. That doesn't sound like something you'd want in most cases.

# unless they have CEASEFIRE and TURRET_CEASEFIRE attributes with that kingdom
# or have the kingdoms.land.bypass.creative permission.
# Note that this does not disable their fly for their safety.
force-survival-mode: true

# auto-revoke: If a kingdom declares that they no longer wish to be in a relation with the
#              other kingdom, the other kingdom will automatically have this relation revoked as well.
# ceasefire: Members of the two kingdoms cannot PvP each other.
# donate: Kingdoms can donate resource points to each other clicking their nexus. Note that they'll still be able to use /k donate
# build: Kingdoms can build in each others lands, however you can't touch any turrets or structures.
# invade: If kingdoms can invade each other.
# interact: Kingdoms can interact and open chests, enchantment tables and other containers.
# use: Kingdoms can use buttons, open doors and use pressure plates.
# home: Allow players to teleport to home of these kingdoms using /k home <kingdom>
# manage: Kingdoms can remove and place turrets and structures in your land.
#         Note that the placed turrets/structures will be for the kingdom that owns that land.
# limit: How many kingdoms can a single kingdom have this type of relation with? Set to 0 for unlimited.
# effects: List of potion effects activated when in these lands.
# customizable: This merely manages the data saved, so it applies after a server restart.
#               To disable it completely, remove it from the Nexus Settings GUI. The players will
#               keep their relation data until the server is restarted if you keep the GUI.
#               Note that NOT specifiying this option defaults to true
# show-holograms: Should turret and structure holograms be shown to them?
# pvp: Only works if the main PvP mode option is set to "relational", this accepts all the same options
#      as the main PvP mode. This also requires a restart.
# conditions: A list of conditions that supports placeholders with the primary context as the
#             sender kingdom and the secondary context as the receiver kingdom
