# Protect your containers using a sign.

# Completely disable this system. Requires a restart to work.
# Note that the data and the placed signs will still remain, but
# they will not work until this is turned back on. If you turn this back on,
# the previous data on the old protected blocks will continue to work even if
# that block or its sign no longer exist.
enabled: true

# If set to false, the protection data will remain and if someone wants
# to access the chest they must break the sign or the chest.
# This is useful when unclaiming by mistake.
protect-unclaimed: false

# Protect the chest and sign from these environmental actions.
protections:
  # This will protect blocks and the sign regardless of the anti-explosion misc upgrade.
  explosion: true
  piston: true

  # All the options listed under this entry are cached for performance reasons.
  # Meaning that a server restart is required for changes to take effect.
  container-transfers:
    # You might want to disable this option completely if your server has a lot
    # of hoppers. This will significantly help.
    # By disabling this option no item transfers will be accepted even if
    # the container transferring the items belongs to the owner.
    # This option only works if "enabled" is true.
    disallow-all: false

    # Disallow members of a protected container who can access it transfer its items using
    # other containers (such as hoppers) that they own and is also protected.
    # If set to true, only the container owner can do this.
    # Fore more info visit the wiki.
    # This option only works if "disallow-all" is false and "enabled" is true.
    disallow-cross-origin-container-transfers: true

# Sound played when someone tries to break/access the chest or sign.
denied-sound: BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_BASS

# This feature is only useful for containers (chests, furnaces and etc) and not any other blocks.
passwords:
  # The maximum password length that owners can set.
  length:
    min: 5
    max: 20

  # How many times can players get the password wrong before they're put in a cooldown?
  # Set to 0 to disable.
  max-attempts: 3

  # For how long are players disallowed to retry entering the password again?
  # This cooldown is not persistent between restarts.
  # This option requires a restart to be applied.
  max-attempts-cooldown: 30mins

  # The keyword used to remove the password from the container.
  # This means that this word cannot be used as a password.
  # Note: You have to also change the message in the language filel.
  remove-keyword: 'remove'

  # The amount of time that the sign remembers who
  # knows the password so they can access the container
  # without entering the password again.
  # This time resets when the player opens the container.
  # Requires a restart to work.
  cookies: 6hrs

# If you have a sign in your hand and you left-click,
# you'll protect the chest automatically.
quick-protect:
  enabled: true

  # Should be sneakign while left-clicking to place the sign?
  sneak: true

# Blocks that can be sign protected.
# Note that not all blocks can be properly protected. For example two-part plants like roses
# can't be protected properly and will leave a ghost-protected block behind and it wouldn't make sense
# to protect such blocks anyways.
