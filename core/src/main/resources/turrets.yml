# The accuracy of the turrets based on ticks.
# Basically what this option does is that it updates
# cached data from previous turret fires in order to
# improve performance.
# The number on this option shows the amount of ticks
# it takes for each turret to update their data again.
# - Higher number means less accuracy.
# - Higher number means more performance.
# - Must be between 1 and infinity.
# - This option is not affected by "update-ticks" option.
# - Values between 1 and 5 will just give extra overhead and should not be used.
# - Set to 0 to disable. (Instant updates)
# - This option doesn't take turret cooldown into account, so it doesn't matter whether a
#   turret has 5 or 10 tick cooldown, it will recheck after 20 absolute server ticks.
# For example a high number like 100 can mean that if a player were
# to go out of a turret's range, the turret will continue to attempt to
# shoot the playr for another 5 seconds until its surroundings are updated.
# - Other delayed scenarios include changing the turret settings, adding ammo,
#   spawning mobs, killed players, etc.
# - This approach will also slightly increase memory usage depending on how many turrets you have.
# * Requires a restart to update.
accuracy: 20

# WARNING: BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING THIS OPTION:
# - By changing this option you're changing how often turrets perform checks and activate.
# - By default, it's every 1 tick. Meaning every 1 second, 20 checks are performed.
# - If you change it to 2 ticks for instance, all the turrets will be affected.
#   Meaning if the turret's cooldown was "10" ticks now it's "10 * 2 = 20" ticks.
#   For example, if you set this to 20, all turrets are limited to shoot every second,
#   no matter how long the cooldown is.
# - Every single number of this option matters up to 100 ticks for performance.
#   After 100 ticks the performance is just not noticable anymore, unless
#   you have an unusual high number of turrets.
# - While this option and "accuracy" are very similar, this option has more impact
#   on performance compared to "accuracy" option. Since the previous option removed
#   some of the checks for performance, but this option will entirely put the turrets
#   into a "sleeping" state which causes them to not shoot at all.
# * Requires a restart to update.
