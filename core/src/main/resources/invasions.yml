# Prevents strong kingdoms from enemying and invading weak kingdoms.
# The person trying to invade/enemy is the primary context of this inequation and the
# person being enemy'd/invaded is the secondary context.
# To disable, set this to "false"
# If this condition evaluates to true, you cannot invade.
# A good strategy would be the following:
#strength-comparison: |
#  (kingdoms_structures_total - {other*kingdoms_structures_total} > 50) ||
#  (kingdoms_turrets_total - {other*kingdoms_turrets_total} > 100) ||
#  (kingdoms_claims - {other*kingdoms_claims} > 50)
strength-comparison: false

# By default, your kingdom can only invade one kingdom at a time.
# 0 means no limit.
simultaneous-invasions: 1

# Whether doing "/k invade" invades multiple lands or just one that the player
# is currently standing in.
multi-chunk-invasion:
  # Ignores unclaimed lands and searches the lands
  # with a simple square algorithm. This ignores any land
  # that doesn't belong to the kingdom which the player is
  # standing on.
  # So 3 means 3x3 = 9 chunks around the player
  # This also ignores any chunks protected by powercells.
  # Set to 1 or 0 to disable
  radius: 1

# This prevents players from running straight to the center
# of claims and invading that area. Players will be forced to
# invade neighboring chunks and fight their way through
# their targetted land. This protection only works
# for lands that have all their sides surrounded by another claim.
# Using this option makes powercells useless for the most part.
adjoining-protection:
  # The chunk radius of the protection. This controls the amount of
  # square ring layers around the chunk that the player wants to invade.
  # If the chunk that the player wants to invade is fully surrounded by
  # the amount of rings specified here (to relax this option, check the option below)
  # then the player won't be able to invade that specific chunk.
  # E.g. 1 -> 3x3 = 9 (including the center chunk), 2 -> 5x5 = 25
  # Set to 0 to completely disable this protection system.
  radius: 0

  # The best way to explain this option is with an example:
  # E.g. When the radius is set to 1 and this is set to 1:
  # If a land has 7 claims around it, it'll still protect this
  # land since it only has 1 missing surrounding claims. (1 radius -> 1 land surrounding each side of
  # a chunk -> 3x3 = 9 -> excluding the target land itself -> 8 lands -> out of these 8 lands around
  # the target chunk one is not claimed -> 7 claimed lands)
  # Be careful with this value as you can technically make a kingdom completely immune to invasions.
  marginal-error-limit: 0

# Resources taken after invading a normal land.
# For nexus land resources there's a separate section.
# Refer to "on-nexus-loss"
bonus:
  # The bonuses get smaller and smaller every time you invade a new land from the same kingdom.
  # These are different when invading the nexus chunk, check below section.
  # You can also use the "ransack" boolean placeholder here.
