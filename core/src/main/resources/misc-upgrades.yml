# https://github.com/CryptoMorin/KingdomsX/wiki/NFAQ#making-custom-misc-upgrades
# This example is not used by default inside the misc upgrades nexus GUI, so players
# will not be able to use it by default. To fix it you'd have to go to the GUI and
# add an option named "custom-misc-upgrade"
# Note that for this to function properly, you also need to remove permissions when
# a player leaves their kingdom. To do this, you have to use the events option in config.yml
