      {$sep}They are planned invasions.
      When you want to invade someone, you
      have to plan an invasion in advance.

      You click the amount of time you want
      to give to your enemy before being able
      to attack them. After this time has passed
      you will have {$p}6 hours {$sep}to invade any of
      the lands of the challenged kingdom.
