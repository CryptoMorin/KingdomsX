      {$sep}They're all under {$p}500kb
      {$sep}note that always the latest version is
      downloaded, so if a GUI/message gets
      renamed, moved or deleted which rarely
      happens, the plugin &cwill not be able
      to show them.

      {$p}English {$sep}is always installed and
      &ccannot be uninstalled {$sep}since its
      the 'reference' language.

      {$sep}All downloaded language packs are saved
      in a folder named {$p}repository{$sep}. That
      folder should never be edited manually.
      That's the reference folder.

      If you want to modify the downloaded
      languages, you should do so in the
      {$p}languages {$sep}folder instead. Even deleting
      those are fine, the plugin will regenerate
      them back without redownloading.
