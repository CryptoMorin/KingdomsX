      {$sep}NBT {$sep}({$sep}Named Binary Tag{$sep}) {$sep}is a way
      for Minecraft to store data for different
      things in the game such as items, entities
      and blocks in general.

      Everything you see on an item, such
      as its name, lore, enchants and etc are
      all stored as NBT data. You almost
      will and should not modify NBT data
      directly as they're extremely hard
      to work with.

      This is mostly for debugging purposes
      to see what's actually going on under
      the hood.
