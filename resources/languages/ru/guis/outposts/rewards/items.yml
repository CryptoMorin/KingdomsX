      {$sep}These items are randomly
      thrown in the Outpost event
      area and players can pick
      them up.

      You can freely interact with
      the items in this GUI, taking
      them and adding your own.

      To make custom items you can use
      the {$p}/k admin item editor
      {$sep}command as well.
