      to work, both kingdoms need to have the
      attribute enabled for the relationship.

      For example, if you have {$e}BUILD {$es}attribute
      enabled for allies, but you're trying to
      build in an ally's land that doesn't
      have {$e}BUILD {$es}attribute enabled for allies,
      this won't work. They won't be able to
      build in your land either.
